			<h2>About the Teen Camp</h2>
			<br />
			<div>
				<p>
					The Accra Ridge Church Teen Camp is an annual 5 day retreat to allow teens a time of 
					retreat from daily routines and pressures; to reflect on what their relationships with 
					God really mean, and to discover new depths in their understanding of and approach to
					Christianity. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Teen Camp programme comprises structured and unstructured sessions, talks, bible studies,
					games and recreational activities, fasting, prayer sessions, and counselling designed to
					achieve this objective.
				</p>
				<p>
					Teen Camp is in its eleventh year and has been a blessing year after year, now not to just the 
					teenagers and youth of Accra Ridge Church but those of other churches too. In the past three 
					years, it has attracted so many campers and to the glory of God the numbers have risen year 
					after year.

					<h4>Teen Camp 2013</h4>
					This year, Teen Camp is from the 4th to 8th of September, with the theme ,Love Unlimited: Experience the Father’s Love'. 
					It is based on 1 John 3:1 and Ephesians 2:4-6.					The purpose of this year’s camp is to enable 
					the teenager understand the depth of the Father's great and immeasurable love lavished on us which the world does not know because it did not know him . We hope to motivate campers to experience the fathers love in its immeasurable depth in their life.

				</p>

				<p>
					If you are between the ages of 11 and 18, enroll at this year’s teen camp and join us Experience the Father’s Love.
